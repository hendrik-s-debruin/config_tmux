tmux configuration
================================================================================

This repository tracks my `tmux` configuration. It is fairly minimal, as I
prefer to use my window manager, [i3](https://i3wm.org/), to mux my terminals. I
only use `tmux` when `ssh`ing into other machines.

I recommend using
[ConfigManager](https://github.com/hendrik-s-debruin/ConfigManager) to track
this repository, but you are free to manually install the files yourself.
